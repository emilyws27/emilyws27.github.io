            Hi there, I'm Emily ðŸ‘‹
            I am a third year at Washington University in St. Louis where I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish and Anthropology.
            I'm studying abroad this fall in Madrid, Spain, but I spent the summer working at Zillow on the Billing Development team. 
            I created a multi-invoice payment system to ease the transaction process for landlords with multiple properties.
            
            Right now, my primary focus is Hack WashU! My friends and I are organizing WashU's first hacakthon in over 7 years,
             and I'd love it if you'd check us out. Our event is taking place in just a few short weeks-- October 14-16, 2022.
            
            Technically speaking, I have a diverse skillset. I am confident in my abilities in the following areas, but I am always working to build out my knowledge base:
            <ul>
                <li>Backend Development</li>
                <li>Data Science</li>
                <li>Quantum Computing</li>
                <li>DevOps</li>
            </ul>
            Think we might work well together or just want to reach out? Shoot me an email at e.sheehan(at)wustl.edu!
