            Thanks for checking out my website! I am a student, programmer, sports fanatic, and animal lover. I attend university in Missouri but I call Massachusetts home. My life revolves around a spoiled-brat of the canine variety, named Jarvis, whose good looks, sweet little eyes, and fluffy coat keep him around.
